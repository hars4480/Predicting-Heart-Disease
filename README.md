# Predicting Heart Disease using Supervised Learning - Classification Algorithms
    
Description
    
* Context: This task is to predict occurance of a heart disease, based on given predictors. 
* The tasks involves, EDA, data pre-processing, model building and model evalation. 
* The following supervised Classification algorithms are used and evauated with both SKlearn and AUTO ML packages. 
 
    * Random Forest Classifier
    * Extra Trees Classifier
    * Ridge Classifier
    * Logistic Regression
    * Linear Discriminant Analysis
    * Gradient Boosting Classifier
    * K Neighbors Classifier
    * Light Gradient Boosting Machine
    * Naive Bayes
    * Extreme Gradient Boosting
    * Ada Boost Classifier
    * SVM - Linear Kernel
    * Decision Tree Classifier
    * Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
    * Dummy Classifier

* Also, trained with Tenserflow with GPU on Cola, with 80% validation accuracy.
